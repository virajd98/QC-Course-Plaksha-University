    "Instead of a continuous spread, the detector screen shows two distinct spots.  This implies that silver atoms can only have two quantized spin states, deflecting in either one direction or the other depending on their state.\n",

    "Look at figure $1.3 (c)$. Can you come up with an explanation for this observation? Its not intuitive at all to explain in words. In the language of operators, this observation is because the operator representing $SGz$ does not commute with $SGx$ and hence they obey an uncertainty relation (just like position and momentum)"

    "From figure $1.2$ its evident that the spin magnetic moment of the electron is quantized (only two discrete values are possible). Let's use the physical property of *spin magnetic moment* of the outer most electron to describe the silver atom's state.  Let $\\ket{z, +}$ and $\\ket{z, -}$ (one call call these spin up and spin down, respectively) denote the possible spin states of the silver atoms when they come out of the $SG_z$ set-up and observed using a detector. \n",
    "\n",
    "From figure $1.3 (a)$ when the atoms in $\\ket{z, -}$ are blocked and only the ones with $\\ket{z, +}$ are allowed again through a $SG_z$ we see only $\\ket{z, +}$ states again. This is like saying $\\ket{z, -}$ has no component of $\\ket{z, +}$, hence when we formalize the state representation using the language of linear algebra where the states would be denoted by abstract vectors, we better be sure that these vectors are orthonormal to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "From figure $1.3 (b)$ when the atoms in state $\\ket{z, +}$ are passed through a $SG_x$ we again see only two discrete outcomes but now the states should be represented differently, say $\\ket{x, +}$ and $\\ket{x, -}$. This observation is like saying that $\\ket{z, +}$ states are also states with some amplitude along $\\ket{x, +}$ and $\\ket{x, -}$. This is weird classically right? How can a classical top which is known to be spinning with spin angular momentum vector purely pointing in the postive z-direction (just as the $\\ket{z, +}$ state), also spin a little in the x-direction and a little in the -x direction? Looks like a statement that contradicts itself. Yes it is, if you you're still attuned to the thinking of states being 'deterministic'. \n",

This weirdness is worse than the earlier one. Classically we would expect only a $\\ket{z, +}$ beam as the $\\ket{z, -}$ beam was earlier blocked right?  It looks like there is no memory of the first filter ($SG_z$):  the particles coming out of the second machine ($SG_x$) are not anymore $\\ket{z, +}$. \n",

    "    * The square of the amplitude associated with the states represent the probability of observing the state when spin magnetic moment is measured along the z-direction. Before measurement the state is just $\\ket {\\psi}$. In the deterministic realm, we would ask if it's $\\ket{z, -}$ or $\\ket{z, +}$, but quantum mechanically this question makes no sense unless an observation (or measurement, loosely speaking) is made. Once observed, we saw that half of the atoms deflected up and half deflected down, hence the amplitude values here make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The state $\\ket {\\psi}$ is an example of a qubit, a word used in the context of quantum computing, and we shall see throughout the course that a system in a linear superposition of multiple states (like $\\ket {\\psi}$  is simultaneously in $\\ket{z, -}$ and $\\ket{z, +}$) could have tremondous computational capabilities.**\n",

Think of $i$ and $-i$ entering into picture just because we have run out of real numbers that satisfies the experimental observations (equal distribution and orthonormality).
