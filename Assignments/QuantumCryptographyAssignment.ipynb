    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> The key we are using is classical, which means that it is not truly random.\n",
    "<li> The key is an (overly) important resource. For quantum One-Time Pad, we need a key that is twice as long as the message, and Anshu and Bharat will be unable to communicate once they run out of keys.\n",
